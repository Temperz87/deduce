./test/should-error/all_intro_advice1.pf:5.3-5.4: incomplete proof
Goal:
	(all x:bool, y:bool. (all z:bool, w:bool. (all n:bool. (x or y or y or not x))))
Advice:
	Prove this "all" formula with:
		arbitrary x:bool, y:bool
	followed by a proof of:
		(all z:bool, w:bool. (all n:bool. (x or y or y or not x)))
