./test/should-error/all_intro_advice2.pf:5.3-5.4: incomplete proof
Goal:
	(all x:bool. (all y:bool. (all z:bool. (all w:bool. (all n:bool. (x or y or y or not x))))))
Advice:
	Prove this "all" formula with:
		arbitrary x:bool
	followed by a proof of:
		(all y:bool. (all z:bool. (all w:bool. (all n:bool. (x or y or y or not x)))))
