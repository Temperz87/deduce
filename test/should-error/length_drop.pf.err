./test/should-error/length_drop.pf:18.5-18.6: incomplete proof
Goal:
	length_nat(switch xs { case [] { @[]<T> } case node(x, xs') { drop(n', xs') } }) = length_nat(xs) ∸ suc(n')
Advice:
	To prove this equality, one of these statements might help:
		expand
		replace
		equations

Givens:
	IH: (all xs:List<T>. length_nat(drop(n', xs)) = length_nat(xs) ∸ n')
