./test/should-error/induction2.pf:15.3-15.4: incomplete proof
Goal:
	(all T:Tree. size(T) = size(T))
Advice:
	Prove this "all" formula with:
		arbitrary T:Tree
	followed by a proof of:
		size(T) = size(T)

	Alternatively, you can try induction with:
		induction Tree
		case empty(b1) {
		  ?
		}
		case node(T1, N2, T3) suppose IH1: size(T1) = size(T1),
			IH2: size(T3) = size(T3) {
		  ?
		}
