./test/should-error/induction2.pf:20.3-20.4: incomplete proof
Goal:
	(all T:Tree. size(T) = size(flip(T)))
Advice:
	Prove this "all" formula with:
		arbitrary T:Tree
	followed by a proof of:
		size(T) = size(flip(T))

	Alternatively, you can try induction with:
		induction Tree
		case empty(b1) {
		  ?
		}
		case node(T1, N2, T3) assume IH1: size(T1) = size(flip(T1)),
			IH2: size(T3) = size(flip(T3)) {
		  ?
		}
