theorem length_node42: length([42]) = 1
proof
  suffices 1 + 0 = 1
      by definition {length, length}
  add_zero[1]
end

theorem length_one_nat_again: all x:Nat. length([x]) = 1
proof
  arbitrary x:Nat
  suffices 1 + 0 = 1
      by definition {length, length}
  add_zero[1]
end

theorem append_xy:
  all T:type. all x:T, y:T. [x] ++ [y] = [x, y]
proof
    arbitrary T:type
    arbitrary x:T, y:T
    definition {operator ++, operator ++}
end

theorem length_one_equal: all U:type. all x:U, y:U.
  length([x]) = length([y])
proof
  arbitrary U:type
  arbitrary x:U, y:U
  rewrite length_one<U>[x] | length_one<U>[y]
end


theorem append_empty_again: all U :type. all xs :List<U>.
  xs ++ [] = xs
proof
  arbitrary U:type
  induction List<U>
  case [] {
    conclude @[]<U> ++ [] = []  by definition operator++
  }
  case node(n, xs') suppose IH: xs' ++ empty = xs' {
    equations
      node(n,xs') ++ empty
          = node(n, xs' ++ empty)   by definition operator++
      ... = node(n,xs')             by rewrite IH
