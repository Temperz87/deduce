theorem contra_false: all a:bool, b:bool.
  if (a = b) and (a = true) and (b = false) then false
proof
  arbitrary a:bool, b:bool
  suppose prem: a = b and a = true and b = false
  have a_true: a = true by prem
  have b_true: b = false by prem

  have X: (true = b) and (true = true) and (b = false)
    by rewrite a_true in prem  
  have Y: (true = true) and (true = true) and (true = false)
    by rewrite b_true in X
  have Z: false
    by Y

  conclude false by rewrite a_true | b_true in prem
