theorem T: (f(c) and f(c)) = (f(c) and f(c))
proof
  equations
     (#f(c)# and f(c)) = (true and f(c))    by definition f
   $ (true and #f(c)#) = (true and true)    by definition f
                   ... = (#f(c)# and true)  by definition f
                   ... = (f(c) and #f(c)#)  by definition f
