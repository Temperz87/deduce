theorem iff_trans : all x : bool, y : bool, z : bool.
  if (x <=> y) and (y <=> z) then (x <=> z)
proof
  arbitrary x:bool, y:bool, z:bool
  suppose label
  have xtz : if x then z
    by suppose px
      apply label to (apply label to px)
  have ztx : if z then x
    by suppose pz
        apply label to (apply label to pz)
  ztx, xtz
end
