# Reporting bugs

This section guides you through submitting an bug reports for Deduce.

### Before submitting a bug report

Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
    - Please make sure to specify whether you are using the [latest Deduce release](https://github.com/jsiek/deduce/releases) or the [main development branch](https://github.com/jsiek/deduce/tree/main).
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://jsiek.github.io/deduce/). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
    - Stack trace (Traceback)
        - Please note whether this is a Deduce error message or a python error message.
    - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
    - Python version


### How do I submit a good bug report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.
