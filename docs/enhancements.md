# Suggesting enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Deduce, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

### Before submitting an enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the [latest version](https://github.com/jsiek/deduce/tree/main).
- Read the [documentation](https://jsiek.github.io/deduce/) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.

### How do I submit a good enhancement suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Deduce users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
